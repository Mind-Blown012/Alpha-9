# Alpha 9
A simple and lightweight game-engine that runs reliably and fast. It supports 2D and 3D graphics and multi-platform support including builds for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and possibly later build support for IOS and Android. The only graphics API currently supported is OpenGL, but DirectX/Direct3D and Vulkan may be supported in later releases.
